## 문제 설명

Given an integer array arr and a mapping function fn, return a new array with a transformation applied to each element.

The returned array should be created such that returnedArray[i] = fn(arr[i], i).

Please solve it without the built-in Array.map method.

## 제한사항

0 <= arr.length <= 1000
-109 <= arr[i] <= 109
fn returns an integer.
