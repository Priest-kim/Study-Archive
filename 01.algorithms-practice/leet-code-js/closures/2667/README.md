## 문제 설명

Write a function createCounter. It should accept an initial integer init. It should return an object with three functions.

The three functions are:

increment() increases the current value by 1 and then returns it.
decrement() reduces the current value by 1 and then returns it.
reset() sets the current value to init and then returns it.

## 제한사항

-1000 <= init <= 1000
0 <= calls.length <= 1000
calls[i] is one of "increment", "decrement" and "reset"
